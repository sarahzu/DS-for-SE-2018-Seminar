Dear Alice and Sarah,

 I found the two worksheets very well written and showing a thorough understanding of the papers, hence I am happy to give you a 6 for this week's assignment.
I particularly appreciated that you did additional research to better grasp some of the statistical concepts that you did not know beforehand ("we had to do some research to fully understand why they were choosen and exactly what they were used for"). This is very good, as it is important to also practice and learn how to find answers by yourselves.

I'll make sure to discuss in class the aspects that you mentioned are not clear in one of the papers.

Well done!

Alberto
