## When, How, and Why Developers (Do Not) Test in Their IDEs

## Questions

1. What is the **main research question/goal**?

The main goal is to study how developers test in their IDE and to identify the habits of how developers drive software development with testing.  To understand the testing patterns the researchers compared the _state of the practice_ to the _state of the art_ of testing and tried to answer the following research questions:
1) _When and Why Do Developers Test?_
2) _How and Why Do Developers Run Tests?_
3) _How Do Developers React to Test Runs?_
4) _Do Developers Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD)?_
5) _How Much Do Developers Test?_


2. Why is this paper **important**?

It is substantial to gain knowledge about how, when and why developers actually test, since this knowledge can be used to determine whether the used testing practices could be one reason for the observed bug proneness of software in practice. 

This paper wants to gain a better understanding of the actual testing practices and questions the common expectations and beliefs about software testing. Since this study was done in a large and varied population of software engineers in the real world, the findings can be used to form a new basis for further researches and practitioners: 

* Further researches can build their contributions on the findings in this paper instead of on the common expectations and beliefs. By doing so, they can make their findings more valid. 
* Software Engineers can use the findings to change their testing behaviour. When they are aware that they overestimate their testing time, they might start to put more effort to perform tests, which might lead to better software quality.


3. What is the **methodology** used to answer the research question(s) or reach the goal?


4. What **data** does the paper use?


5. If there is a **statistical model**, what is the product, behavior, or process being modeled? What are the key characteristics of the model?


6. What are the **limitations** of using this methodology on the results?


7. What is **the answer** to the research question? _(in case of a goal: What is the contribution of the paper towards that goal?)_


8. What did you **not understand** of this paper?
