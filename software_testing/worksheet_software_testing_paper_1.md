## Questions

1. What is the **main research question/goal**?

The main goal is to study how developers test in their IDE and to identify the habits of how developers drive software development with testing.  To understand the testing patterns the researchers compared the _state of the practice_ to the _state of the art_ of testing and tried to answer the following research questions:
1) When and Why Do Developers Test?
2) How and Why Do Developers Run Tests?
3) How Do Developers React to Test Runs?
4) Do Developers Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD)?
5) How Much Do Developers Test?


2. Why is this paper **important**?


3. What is the **methodology** used to answer the research question(s) or reach the goal?


4. What **data** does the paper use?


5. If there is a **statistical model**, what is the product, behavior, or process being modeled? What are the key characteristics of the model?


6. What are the **limitations** of using this methodology on the results?


7. What is **the answer** to the research question? _(in case of a goal: What is the contribution of the paper towards that goal?)_


8. What did you **not understand** of this paper?
