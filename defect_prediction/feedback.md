Dear Alice and Sarah,

I checked both the worksheets and they are of pretty good quality: The answers are to the point and show an understanding of the paper that is at the expected level. I particularly liked the depth of the answers to the first two questions. The current grade for that worksheet would have been 5.7. To get a 6, you have to strengthen the part about the limitations, for example explaining the problems coming from these limitations (right now it reports what the issues are but more critical discussion is necessary). Make sure when you discuss the problems emerging from the limitations to motivate them either through solid argomentation or literature.

Good luck with the new ones!
