## Convergent Contemporary Software Peer Review Practices

## Questions

1. What is the **main research question/goal**? _(there may be more than one, but usually there is an overarching research question/goal.)_

This paper aims to explore aspects of contemporary peer review in software projects that have varying domains, organisations and development processes. The authors assume that if peer review practices in different projects have become similar, then these practices may represent successful methods of review. In order to check their assumption they firstly explored the following main research question:

"_How do the parameters of peer review differ in multiple disparate projects?_"

The following parameters of review were considered:
1) What peer review process (e.g., Fagan inspection vs Commit-then-review) does the project use?
2) How long do reviews take and how often are reviews performed?
3) What is the size of artifact under review?
4) How many people are involved in review?
5) How eï¬€ective is review in terms of problems discussed?
6) Does review spread knowledge about the system across the development team?

2. Why is this paper **important**?


3. What is the **methodology** used to answer the research question(s) or reach the goal?


4. What **data** does the paper use?


5. If there is a **statistical model**, what is the product, behavior, or process being modeled? What are the key characteristics of the model?


6. What are the **limitations** of using this methodology on the results?


7. What is **the answer** to the research question? _(in case of a goal: What is the contribution of the paper towards that goal?)_


8. What did you **not understand** of this paper?
