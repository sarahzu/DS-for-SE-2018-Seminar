## Convergent Contemporary Software Peer Review Practices

## Questions

1. What is the **main research question/goal**? _(there may be more than one, but usually there is an overarching research question/goal.)_

This paper aims to explore aspects of contemporary peer review in software projects that have varying domains, organisations and development processes. The authors assume that if peer review practices in different projects have become similar, then these practices may represent successful methods of review. In order to check their assumption they firstly explored the following main research question:

"_How do the parameters of peer review differ in multiple disparate projects?_"

The following parameters of review were considered:
* _What peer review process (e.g., Fagan inspection vs Commit-then-review) does the project use?_
* _How long do reviews take and how often are reviews performed?_
* What is the size of artifact under review?_
* _How many people are involved in review?_
* _How eï¬€ective is review in terms of problems discussed?_
* _Does review spread knowledge about the system across the development team?_

2. Why is this paper **important**?

Peer review refers to the practice of other authors inspecting software code. It is performed to find errors/defects and improve the overall quality of the software. In addition to this, peer review has many other advantages, as for example sharing knowledge and team cohesion. So, it is important to thoughtfully explore this practice and find efficient methods. 

Studies have shown that traditional review practices limit software adoption and review efficiency. The traditional review practices evolved over time to contemporary peer reviews which follow less rigid practices. This paper is important since it is one of the first studies that explores aspects of contemporary peer review. If they find similar peer review practices which evolved in different projects, then these practices may represent successful and efficient review methods. Using this knowledge it will be possible to make suggestions for other software projects on how to perform efficient peer review.
