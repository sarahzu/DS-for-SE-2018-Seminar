Dear Alice and Sarah,
 
  Your two worksheet for this week are of very high quality and I am glad to give you a 6 for your work. Well done!
 
  I found particularly well thought your last remark about the first paper: "We did not fully understand how exactly they came up with these alternative     measures and why they believe these measures provide an approximations of review effectiveness." Indeed, it would be interesting to evaluate whether and    how actually these measures are a good proxy for review effectiveness. I hope we have enough time in class to discuss this valuable remark.
 
  Alberto
