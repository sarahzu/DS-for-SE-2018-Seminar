# Predicting Defects for Eclipse

## Questions

1. What is the **main research question/goal**? _(there may be more than one, but usually there is an overarching research question/goal.)_

Research Question: Which files/packages have defects (a classification problem)? Which are the files/packages with the most defects (a ranking problem)? Does complex code implify more defects?
The goal is to support a allocation of resouces for quality assurance to parts of a system that are most defect-prone. Proove the hypothesis with complexity measures. Another goal is to provide their data to futur researches in software engineering. 

2. Why is this paper **important**?

They discovered that the complexity metrics can predict defects suggesting that more complex code lead to more defects. If developers know that more complex code is more likely to leads to defects, they can focus on these specific parts in their project and therefore save time. 

3. What is the **methodology** used to answer the research question(s) or reach the goal?

They used experiments using Eclipse bug data set. They computed the Spearman correlation between the number of pre-releases and post-releas defects and the complextity metrics in the data set. They build logist logistic regression models for the Eclipse bug data set to predict wheter files/packages have post-release defects. 

4. What **data** does the paper use?
5. If there is a **statistical model**, what is the product, behavior, or process being modeled? What are the key characteristics of the model?
6. What are the **limitations** of using this methodology on the results?
7. What is **the answer** to the research question? _(in case of a goal: What is the contribution of the paper towards that goal?)_
8. What did you **not understand** of this paper?
